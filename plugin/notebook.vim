" Description: {{{
"   Plugin which allows you to organize sets of notes using vim's simple help
"   file format providing support to search those notes or jump to a specific
"   tag.
"
"   Note: This plugin will recognize any txt file in your notebook directory
"   as a notebook file, but if for some reason it doesn't or you want to use a
"   different file extension, you can add the following modeline to the end of
"   your file to force the proper file type:
"
"     vim:ft=notebook
"
"   An example of my usage: I have my notes broken up into folders of high
"   level topics and in those folders are notes which fall under those topics
"   (note, you can create further nested directories as needed as well):
"
"     database/
"       mysql.txt         (notes on mysql)
"       oracle.txt        (notes on oracle)
"       postgresql.txt    (notes on postgresql)
"       ...
"     languages/
"       c.txt
"       java.txt
"       ...
"     vcs/
"       git.txt
"       hg.txt
"       svn.txt
"     ...
"
"   Then I can lookup notes on git using:
"     :Notebook git
